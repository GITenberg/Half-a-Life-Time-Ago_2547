<h1>HALF A LIFE-TIME AGO.</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Half</span> a life-time ago, there lived
in one of the Westmoreland dales a single woman, of the name of
Susan Dixon.&nbsp; She was owner of the small farm-house where
she resided, and of some thirty or forty acres of land by which
it was surrounded.&nbsp; She had also an hereditary right to a
sheep-walk, extending to the wild fells that overhang Blea
Tarn.&nbsp; In the language of the country she was a
Stateswoman.&nbsp; Her house is yet to be seen on the Oxenfell
road, between Skelwith and Coniston.&nbsp; You go along a
moorland track, made by the carts that occasionally came for turf
from the Oxenfell.&nbsp; A brook babbles and brattles by the
wayside, giving you a sense of companionship, which relieves the
deep solitude in which this way is usually traversed.&nbsp; Some
miles on this side of Coniston there is a farmstead&mdash;a gray
stone house, and a square of farm-buildings surrounding a green
space of rough turf, in the midst of which stands a mighty,
funereal umbrageous yew, making a solemn shadow, as of death, in
the very heart and centre of the light and heat of the brightest
summer day.&nbsp; On the side away from the house, this yard
slopes down to a dark-brown pool, which is supplied with fresh
water from the overflowings of a stone cistern, into which some
rivulet of the brook before-mentioned continually and melodiously
falls bubbling.&nbsp; The cattle drink out of this cistern.&nbsp;
The household bring their pitchers and fill them with
drinking-water by a dilatory, yet pretty, process.&nbsp; The
water-carrier brings with her a leaf of the hound&rsquo;s-tongue
fern, and, inserting it in the crevice of the gray rock, makes a
cool, green spout for the sparkling stream.</p>
<p>The house is no specimen, at the present day, of what it was
in the lifetime of Susan Dixon.&nbsp; Then, every small diamond
pane in the windows glittered with cleanliness.&nbsp; You might
have eaten off the floor; you could see yourself in the pewter
plates and the polished oaken awmry, or dresser, of the state
kitchen into which you entered.&nbsp; Few strangers penetrated
further than this room.&nbsp; Once or twice, wandering tourists,
attracted by the lonely picturesqueness of the situation, and the
exquisite cleanliness of the house itself, made their way into
this house-place, and offered money enough (as they thought) to
tempt the hostess to receive them as lodgers.&nbsp; They would
give no trouble, they said; they would be out rambling or
sketching all day long; would be perfectly content with a share
of the food which she provided for herself; or would procure what
they required from the Waterhead Inn at Coniston.&nbsp; But no
liberal sum&mdash;no fair words&mdash;moved her from her stony
manner, or her monotonous tone of indifferent refusal.&nbsp; No
persuasion could induce her to show any more of the house than
that first room; no appearance of fatigue procured for the weary
an invitation to sit down and rest; and if one more bold and less
delicate did so without being asked, Susan stood by, cold and
apparently deaf, or only replying by the briefest monosyllables,
till the unwelcome visitor had departed.&nbsp; Yet those with
whom she had dealings, in the way of selling her cattle or her
farm produce, spoke of her as keen after a bargain&mdash;a hard
one to have to do with; and she never spared herself exertion or
fatigue, at market or in the field, to make the most of her
produce.&nbsp; She led the hay-makers with her swift, steady
rake, and her noiseless evenness of motion.&nbsp; She was about
among the earliest in the market, examining samples of oats,
pricing them, and then turning with grim satisfaction to her own
cleaner corn.</p>
<p>She was served faithfully and long by those who were rather
her fellow-labourers than her servants.&nbsp; She was even and
just in her dealings with them.&nbsp; If she was peculiar and
silent, they knew her, and knew that she might be relied
on.&nbsp; Some of them had known her from her childhood; and deep
in their hearts was an unspoken&mdash;almost
unconscious&mdash;pity for her, for they knew her story, though
they never spoke of it.</p>
<p>Yes; the time had been when that tall, gaunt, hard-featured,
angular woman&mdash;who never smiled, and hardly ever spoke an
unnecessary word&mdash;had been a fine-looking girl,
bright-spirited and rosy; and when the hearth at the Yew Nook had
been as bright as she, with family love and youthful hope and
mirth.&nbsp; Fifty or fifty-one years ago, William Dixon and his
wife Margaret were alive; and Susan, their daughter, was about
eighteen years old&mdash;ten years older than the only other
child, a boy named after his father.&nbsp; William and Margaret
Dixon were rather superior people, of a character
belonging&mdash;as far as I have seen&mdash;exclusively to the
class of Westmoreland and Cumberland statesmen&mdash;just,
independent, upright; not given to much speaking; kind-hearted,
but not demonstrative; disliking change, and new ways, and new
people; sensible and shrewd; each household self-contained, and
its members having little curiosity as to their neighbours, with
whom they rarely met for any social intercourse, save at the
stated times of sheep-shearing and Christmas; having a certain
kind of sober pleasure in amassing money, which occasionally made
them miserable (as they call miserly people up in the north) in
their old age; reading no light or ephemeral literature, but the
grave, solid books brought round by the pedlars (such as the
&ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo; and &ldquo;Regained,&rsquo;&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Death of Abel,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Spiritual
Quixote,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress&rdquo;),
were to be found in nearly every house: the men occasionally
going off laking, <i>i.e.</i> playing, <i>i.e.</i> drinking for
days together, and having to be hunted up by anxious wives, who
dared not leave their husbands to the chances of the wild
precipitous roads, but walked miles and miles, lantern in hand,
in the dead of night, to discover and guide the solemnly-drunken
husband home; who had a dreadful headache the next day, and the
day after that came forth as grave, and sober, and virtuous
looking as if there were no such thing as malt and spirituous
liquors in the world; and who were seldom reminded of their
misdoings by their wives, to whom such occasional outbreaks were
as things of course, when once the immediate anxiety produced by
them was over.&nbsp; Such were&mdash;such are&mdash;the
characteristics of a class now passing away from the face of the
land, as their compeers, the yeomen, have done before them.&nbsp;
Of such was William Dixon.&nbsp; He was a shrewd clever farmer,
in his day and generation, when shrewdness was rather shown in
the breeding and rearing of sheep and cattle than in the
cultivation of land.&nbsp; Owing to this character of his,
statesmen from a distance from beyond Kendal, or from Borrowdale,
of greater wealth than he, would send their sons to be
farm-servants for a year or two with him, in order to learn some
of his methods before setting up on land of their own.&nbsp; When
Susan, his daughter, was about seventeen, one Michael Hurst was
farm-servant at Yew Nook.&nbsp; He worked with the master, and
lived with the family, and was in all respects treated as an
equal, except in the field.&nbsp; His father was a wealthy
statesman at Wythburne, up beyond Grasmere; and through
Michael&rsquo;s servitude the families had become acquainted, and
the Dixons went over to the High Beck sheep-shearing, and the
Hursts came down by Red Bank and Loughrig Tarn and across the
Oxenfell when there was the Christmas-tide feasting at Yew
Nook.&nbsp; The fathers strolled round the fields together,
examined cattle and sheep, and looked knowing over each
other&rsquo;s horses.&nbsp; The mothers inspected the dairies and
household arrangements, each openly admiring the plans of the
other, but secretly preferring their own.&nbsp; Both fathers and
mothers cast a glance from time to time at Michael and Susan, who
were thinking of nothing less than farm or dairy, but whose
unspoken attachment was, in all ways, so suitable and natural a
thing that each parent rejoiced over it, although with
characteristic reserve it was never spoken about&mdash;not even
between husband and wife.</p>
<p>Susan had been a strong, independent, healthy girl; a clever
help to her mother, and a spirited companion to her father; more
of a man in her (as he often said) than her delicate little
brother ever would have.&nbsp; He was his mother&rsquo;s darling,
although she loved Susan well.&nbsp; There was no positive
engagement between Michael and Susan&mdash;I doubt whether even
plain words of love had been spoken; when one winter-time
Margaret Dixon was seized with inflammation consequent upon a
neglected cold.&nbsp; She had always been strong and notable, and
had been too busy to attend to the early symptoms of
illness.&nbsp; It would go off, she said to the woman who helped
in the kitchen; or if she did not feel better when they had got
the hams and bacon out of hand, she would take some herb-tea and
nurse up a bit.&nbsp; But Death could not wait till the hams and
bacon were cured: he came on with rapid strides, and shooting
arrows of portentous agony.&nbsp; Susan had never seen
illness&mdash;never knew how much she loved her mother till now,
when she felt a dreadful, instinctive certainty that she was
losing her.&nbsp; Her mind was thronged with recollections of the
many times she had slighted her mother&rsquo;s wishes; her heart
was full of the echoes of careless and angry replies that she had
spoken.&nbsp; What would she not now give to have opportunities
of service and obedience, and trials of her patience and love,
for that dear mother who lay gasping in torture!&nbsp; And yet
Susan had been a good girl and an affectionate daughter.</p>
<p>The sharp pain went off, and delicious ease came on; yet still
her mother sunk.&nbsp; In the midst of this languid peace she was
dying.&nbsp; She motioned Susan to her bedside, for she could
only whisper; and then, while the father was out of the room, she
spoke as much to the eager, hungering eyes of her daughter by the
motion of her lips, as by the slow, feeble sounds of her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan, lass, thou must not fret.&nbsp; It is
God&rsquo;s will, and thou wilt have a deal to do.&nbsp; Keep
father straight if thou canst; and if he goes out Ulverstone
ways, see that thou meet him before he gets to the Old
Quarry.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a dree bit for a man who has had a
drop.&nbsp; As for lile Will&rdquo;&mdash;Here the poor
woman&rsquo;s face began to work and her fingers to move
nervously as they lay on the bed-quilt&mdash;&ldquo;lile Will
will miss me most of all.&nbsp; Father&rsquo;s often vexed with
him because he&rsquo;s not a quick strong lad; he is not, my poor
lile chap.&nbsp; And father thinks he&rsquo;s saucy, because he
cannot always stomach oat-cake and porridge.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
better than three pound in th&rsquo; old black tea-pot on the top
shelf of the cupboard.&nbsp; Just keep a piece of loaf-bread by
you, Susan dear, for Will to come to when he&rsquo;s not taken
his breakfast.&nbsp; I have, may be, spoilt him; but
there&rsquo;ll be no one to spoil him now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began to cry a low, feeble cry, and covered up her face
that Susan might not see her.&nbsp; That dear face! those
precious moments while yet the eyes could look out with love and
intelligence.&nbsp; Susan laid her head down close by her
mother&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother I&rsquo;ll take tent of Will.&nbsp; Mother, do
you hear?&nbsp; He shall not want ought I can give or get for
him, least of all the kind words which you had ever ready for us
both.&nbsp; Bless you! bless you! my own mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou&rsquo;lt promise me that, Susan, wilt thou?&nbsp;
I can die easy if thou&rsquo;lt take charge of him.&nbsp; But
he&rsquo;s hardly like other folk; he tries father at times,
though I think father&rsquo;ll be tender of him when I&rsquo;m
gone, for my sake.&nbsp; And, Susan, there&rsquo;s one thing
more.&nbsp; I never spoke on it for fear of the bairn being
called a tell-tale, but I just comforted him up.&nbsp; He vexes
Michael at times, and Michael has struck him before now.&nbsp; I
did not want to make a stir; but he&rsquo;s not strong, and a
word from thee, Susan, will go a long way with
Michael.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan was as red now as she had been pale before; it was the
first time that her influence over Michael had been openly
acknowledged by a third person, and a flash of joy came athwart
the solemn sadness of the moment.&nbsp; Her mother had spoken too
much, and now came on the miserable faintness.&nbsp; She never
spoke again coherently; but when her children and her husband
stood by her bedside, she took lile Will&rsquo;s hand and put it
into Susan&rsquo;s, and looked at her with imploring eyes.&nbsp;
Susan clasped her arms round Will, and leaned her head upon his
little curly one, and vowed within herself to be as a mother to
him.</p>
<p>Henceforward she was all in all to her brother.&nbsp; She was
a more spirited and amusing companion to him than his mother had
been, from her greater activity, and perhaps, also, from her
originality of character, which often prompted her to perform her
habitual actions in some new and racy manner.&nbsp; She was
tender to lile Will when she was prompt and sharp with everybody
else&mdash;with Michael most of all; for somehow the girl felt
that, unprotected by her mother, she must keep up her own
dignity, and not allow her lover to see how strong a hold he had
upon her heart.&nbsp; He called her hard and cruel, and left her
so; and she smiled softly to herself, when his back was turned,
to think how little he guessed how deeply he was loved.&nbsp; For
Susan was merely comely and fine looking; Michael was strikingly
handsome, admired by all the girls for miles round, and quite
enough of a country coxcomb to know it and plume himself
accordingly.&nbsp; He was the second son of his father; the
eldest would have High Beck farm, of course, but there was a good
penny in the Kendal bank in store for Michael.&nbsp; When harvest
was over, he went to Chapel Langdale to learn to dance; and at
night, in his merry moods, he would do his steps on the flag
floor of the Yew Nook kitchen, to the secret admiration of Susan,
who had never learned dancing, but who flouted him perpetually,
even while she admired, in accordance with the rule she seemed to
have made for herself about keeping him at a distance so long as
he lived under the same roof with her.&nbsp; One evening he
sulked at some saucy remark of hers; he sitting in the chimney
corner with his arms on his knees, and his head bent forwards,
lazily gazing into the wood-fire on the hearth, and luxuriating
in rest after a hard day&rsquo;s labour; she sitting among the
geraniums on the long, low window-seat, trying to catch the last
slanting rays of the autumnal light to enable her to finish
stitching a shirt-collar for Will, who lounged full length on the
flags at the other side of the hearth to Michael, poking the
burning wood from time to time with a long hazel-stick to bring
out the leap of glittering sparks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you can dance a threesome reel, what good does
it do ye?&rdquo; asked Susan, looking askance at Michael, who had
just been vaunting his proficiency.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does it help you
plough, reap, or even climb the rocks to take a raven&rsquo;s
nest?&nbsp; If I were a man, I&rsquo;d be ashamed to give in to
such softness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were a man, you&rsquo;d be glad to do anything
which made the pretty girls stand round and admire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As they do to you, eh!&nbsp; Ho, Michael, that would
not be my way o&rsquo; being a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would then?&rdquo; asked he, after a pause, during
which he had expected in vain that she would go on with her
sentence.&nbsp; No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not like you as a man, Susy; you&rsquo;d be
too hard and headstrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I hard and headstrong?&rdquo; asked she, with as
indifferent a tone as she could assume, but which yet had a touch
of pique in it.&nbsp; His quick ear detected the inflexion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Susy!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re wilful at times, and
that&rsquo;s right enough.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like a girl
without spirit.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a mighty pretty girl comes to
the dancing class; but she is all milk and water.&nbsp; Her eyes
never flash like yours when you&rsquo;re put out; why, I can see
them flame across the kitchen like a cat&rsquo;s in the
dark.&nbsp; Now, if you were a man, I should feel queer before
those looks of yours; as it is, I rather like them,
because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because what?&rdquo; asked she, looking up and
perceiving that he had stolen close up to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I can make all right in this way,&rdquo; said
he, kissing her suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; said she, wrenching herself out of his
grasp and panting, half with rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take that, by way
of proof that making right is none so easy.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she
boxed his ears pretty sharply.&nbsp; He went back to his seat
discomfited and out of temper.&nbsp; She could no longer see to
look, even if her face had not burnt and her eyes dazzled, but
she did not choose to move her seat, so she still preserved her
stooping attitude and pretended to go on sewing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor Hebthwaite may be milk-and-water,&rdquo;
muttered he, &ldquo;but&mdash;Confound thee, lad! what art thou
doing?&rdquo; exclaimed Michael, as a great piece of burning wood
was cast into his face by an unlucky poke of Will&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thou great lounging, clumsy chap, I&rsquo;ll teach thee
better!&rdquo; and with one or two good round kicks he sent the
lad whimpering away into the back-kitchen.&nbsp; When he had a
little recovered himself from his passion, he saw Susan standing
before him, her face looking strange and almost ghastly by the
reversed position of the shadows, arising from the firelight
shining upwards right under it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell thee what, Michael,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that
lad&rsquo;s motherless, but not friendless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His own father leathers him, and why should not I, when
he&rsquo;s given me such a burn on my face?&rdquo; said Michael,
putting up his hand to his cheek as if in pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His father&rsquo;s his father, and there is nought more
to be said.&nbsp; But if he did burn thee, it was by accident,
and not o&rsquo; purpose; as thou kicked him, it&rsquo;s a mercy
if his ribs are not broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He howls loud enough, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; I might
ha&rsquo; kicked many a lad twice as hard, and they&rsquo;d
ne&rsquo;er ha&rsquo; said ought but &lsquo;damn ye;&rsquo; but
yon lad must needs cry out like a stuck pig if one touches
him;&rdquo; replied Michael, sullenly.</p>
<p>Susan went back to the window-seat, and looked absently out of
the window at the drifting clouds for a minute or two, while her
eyes filled with tears.&nbsp; Then she got up and made for the
outer door which led into the back-kitchen.&nbsp; Before she
reached it, however, she heard a low voice, whose music made her
thrill, say&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan, Susan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her heart melted within her, but it seemed like treachery to
her poor boy, like faithlessness to her dead mother, to turn to
her lover while the tears which he had caused to flow were yet
unwiped on Will&rsquo;s cheeks.&nbsp; So she seemed to take no
heed, but passed into the darkness, and, guided by the sobs, she
found her way to where Willie sat crouched among the disused tubs
and churns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out wi&rsquo; me, lad;&rdquo; and they went out
into the orchard, where the fruit-trees were bare of leaves, but
ghastly in their tattered covering of gray moss: and the soughing
November wind came with long sweeps over the fells till it
rattled among the crackling boughs, underneath which the brother
and sister sat in the dark; he in her lap, and she hushing his
head against her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou should&rsquo;st na&rsquo; play wi&rsquo;
fire.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a naughty trick.&nbsp; Thoul&rsquo;t
suffer for it in worse ways nor this before thou&rsquo;st done,
I&rsquo;m afeared.&nbsp; I should ha&rsquo; hit thee twice as
lungeous kicks as Mike, if I&rsquo;d been in his place.&nbsp; He
did na&rsquo; hurt thee, I am sure,&rdquo; she assumed, half as a
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes but he did.&nbsp; He turned me quite
sick.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he let his head fall languidly down on his
sister&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, lad! come, lad!&rdquo; said she anxiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be a man.&nbsp; It was not much that I saw.&nbsp; Why,
when first the red cow came she kicked me far harder for offering
to milk her before her legs were tied.&nbsp; See thee!
here&rsquo;s a peppermint-drop, and I&rsquo;ll make thee a pasty
to-night; only don&rsquo;t give way so, for it hurts me sore to
think that Michael has done thee any harm, my pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Willie roused himself up, and put back the wet and ruffled
hair from his heated face; and he and Susan rose up, and
hand-in-hand went towards the house, walking slowly and quietly
except for a kind of sob which Willie could not repress.&nbsp;
Susan took him to the pump and washed his tear-stained face, till
she thought she had obliterated all traces of the recent
disturbance, arranging his curls for him, and then she kissed him
tenderly, and led him in, hoping to find Michael in the kitchen,
and make all straight between them.&nbsp; But the blaze had
dropped down into darkness; the wood was a heap of gray ashes in
which the sparks ran hither and thither; but even in the groping
darkness Susan knew by the sinking at her heart that Michael was
not there.&nbsp; She threw another brand on the hearth and
lighted the candle, and sat down to her work in silence.&nbsp;
Willie cowered on his stool by the side of the fire, eyeing his
sister from time to time, and sorry and oppressed, he knew not
why, by the sight of her grave, almost stern face.&nbsp; No one
came.&nbsp; They two were in the house alone.&nbsp; The old woman
who helped Susan with the household work had gone out for the
night to some friend&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; William Dixon, the
father, was up on the fells seeing after his sheep.&nbsp; Susan
had no heart to prepare the evening meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susy, darling, are you angry with me?&rdquo; said
Willie, in his little piping, gentle voice.&nbsp; He had stolen
up to his sister&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t never
play with the fire again; and I&rsquo;ll not cry if Michael does
kick me.&nbsp; Only don&rsquo;t look so like dead
mother&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;please
don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he exclaimed, hiding his face on her
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry, Willie,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be feared on me.&nbsp; You want your supper,
and you shall have it; and don&rsquo;t you be feared on
Michael.&nbsp; He shall give reason for every hair of your head
that he touches&mdash;he shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When William Dixon came home he found Susan and Willie sitting
together, hand-in-hand, and apparently pretty cheerful.&nbsp; He
bade them go to bed, for that he would sit up for Michael; and
the next morning, when Susan came down, she found that Michael
had started an hour before with the cart for lime.&nbsp; It was a
long day&rsquo;s work; Susan knew it would be late, perhaps later
than on the preceding night, before he returned&mdash;at any
rate, past her usual bed-time; and on no account would she stop
up a minute beyond that hour in the kitchen, whatever she might
do in her bed-room.&nbsp; Here she sat and watched till past
midnight; and when she saw him coming up the brow with the carts,
she knew full well, even in that faint moonlight, that his gait
was the gait of a man in liquor.&nbsp; But though she was annoyed
and mortified to find in what way he had chosen to forget her,
the fact did not disgust or shock her as it would have done many
a girl, even at that day, who had not been brought up as Susan
had, among a class who considered it no crime, but rather a mark
of spirit, in a man to get drunk occasionally.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, she chose to hold herself very high all the next
day when Michael was, perforce, obliged to give up any attempt to
do heavy work, and hung about the out-buildings and farm in a
very disconsolate and sickly state.&nbsp; Willie had far more
pity on him than Susan.&nbsp; Before evening, Willie and he were
fast, and, on his side, ostentatious friends.&nbsp; Willie rode
the horses down to water; Willie helped him to chop wood.&nbsp;
Susan sat gloomily at her work, hearing an indistinct but
cheerful conversation going on in the shippon, while the cows
were being milked.&nbsp; She almost felt irritated with her
little brother, as if he were a traitor, and had gone over to the
enemy in the very battle that she was fighting in his
cause.&nbsp; She was alone with no one to speak to, while they
prattled on regardless if she were glad or sorry.</p>
<p>Soon Willie burst in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Susan!&nbsp; Susan! come
with me; I&rsquo;ve something so pretty to show you.&nbsp; Round
the corner of the barn&mdash;run! run!&rdquo;&nbsp; (He was
dragging her along, half reluctant, half desirous of some change
in that weary day.)&nbsp; Round the corner of the barn; and
caught hold of by Michael, who stood there awaiting her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Willie!&rdquo; cried she &ldquo;you naughty
boy.&nbsp; There is nothing pretty&mdash;what have you brought me
here for?&nbsp; Let me go; I won&rsquo;t be held.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one word.&nbsp; Nay, if you wish it so much, you
may go,&rdquo; said Michael, suddenly loosing his hold as she
struggled.&nbsp; But now she was free, she only drew off a step
or two, murmuring something about Willie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going, then?&rdquo; said Michael, with seeming
sadness.&nbsp; &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t hear me say a word of what
is in my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell whether it is what I should like to
hear?&rdquo; replied she, still drawing back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what I want you to tell me; I want you to
hear it and then to tell me whether you like it or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may speak,&rdquo; replied she, turning her
back, and beginning to plait the hem of her apron.</p>
<p>He came close to her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I hurt Willie the other night.&nbsp; He
has forgiven me.&nbsp; Can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hurt him very badly,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you are right to be sorry.&nbsp; I forgive
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, stop!&rdquo; said he, laying his hand upon her
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is something more I&rsquo;ve got to
say.&nbsp; I want you to be my&mdash;what is it they call it,
Susan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said she, half-laughing, but
trying to get away with all her might now; and she was a strong
girl, but she could not manage it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do.&nbsp; My&mdash;what is it I want you to
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you I don&rsquo;t know, and you had best be
quiet, and just let me go in, or I shall think you&rsquo;re as
bad now as you were last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did you know what I was last night?&nbsp; It
was past twelve when I came home.&nbsp; Were you watching?&nbsp;
Ah, Susan! be my wife, and you shall never have to watch for a
drunken husband.&nbsp; If I were your husband, I would come
straight home, and count every minute an hour till I saw your
bonny face.&nbsp; Now you know what I want you to be.&nbsp; I ask
you to be my wife.&nbsp; Will you, my own dear Susan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not speak for some time.&nbsp; Then she only said
&ldquo;Ask father.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now she was really off like a
lapwing round the corner of the barn, and up in her own little
room, crying with all her might, before the triumphant smile had
left Michael&rsquo;s face where he stood.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Ask father&rdquo; was a mere form to be gone
though.&nbsp; Old Daniel Hurst and William Dixon had talked over
what they could respectively give their children before this; and
that was the parental way of arranging such matters.&nbsp; When
the probable amount of worldly gear that he could give his child
had been named by each father, the young folk, as they said,
might take their own time in coming to the point which the old
men, with the prescience of experience, saw they were drifting
to; no need to hurry them, for they were both young, and Michael,
though active enough, was too thoughtless, old Daniel said, to be
trusted with the entire management of a farm.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
his father would look about him, and see after all the farms that
were to be let.</p>
<p>Michael had a shrewd notion of this preliminary understanding
between the fathers, and so felt less daunted than he might
otherwise have done at making the application for Susan&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; It was all right, there was not an obstacle; only a
deal of good advice, which the lover thought might have as well
been spared, and which it must be confessed he did not much
attend to, although he assented to every part of it.&nbsp; Then
Susan was called down stairs, and slowly came dropping into view
down the steps which led from the two family apartments into the
house-place.&nbsp; She tried to look composed and quiet, but it
could not be done.&nbsp; She stood side by side with her lover,
with her head drooping, her cheeks burning, not daring to look up
or move, while her father made the newly-betrothed a somewhat
formal address in which he gave his consent, and many a piece of
worldly wisdom beside.&nbsp; Susan listened as well as she could
for the beating of her heart; but when her father solemnly and
sadly referred to his own lost wife, she could keep from sobbing
no longer; but throwing her apron over her face, she sat down on
the bench by the dresser, and fairly gave way to pent-up
tears.&nbsp; Oh, how strangely sweet to be comforted as she was
comforted, by tender caress, and many a low-whispered promise of
love!&nbsp; Her father sat by the fire, thinking of the days that
were gone; Willie was still out of doors; but Susan and Michael
felt no one&rsquo;s presence or absence&mdash;they only knew they
were together as betrothed husband and wife.</p>
<p>In a week, or two, they were formally told of the arrangements
to be made in their favour.&nbsp; A small farm in the
neighbourhood happened to fall vacant; and Michael&rsquo;s father
offered to take it for him, and be responsible for the rent for
the first year, while William Dixon was to contribute a certain
amount of stock, and both fathers were to help towards the
furnishing of the house.&nbsp; Susan received all this
information in a quiet, indifferent way; she did not care much
for any of these preparations, which were to hurry her through
the happy hours; she cared least of all for the money amount of
dowry and of substance.&nbsp; It jarred on her to be made the
confidante of occasional slight repinings of Michael&rsquo;s, as
one by one his future father-in-law set aside a beast or a pig
for Susan&rsquo;s portion, which were not always the best animals
of their kind upon the farm.&nbsp; But he also complained of his
own father&rsquo;s stinginess, which somewhat, though not much,
alleviated Susan&rsquo;s dislike to being awakened out of her
pure dream of love to the consideration of worldly wealth.</p>
<p>But in the midst of all this bustle, Willie moped and
pined.&nbsp; He had the same chord of delicacy running through
his mind that made his body feeble and weak.&nbsp; He kept out of
the way, and was apparently occupied in whittling and carving
uncouth heads on hazel-sticks in an out-house.&nbsp; But he
positively avoided Michael, and shrunk away even from
Susan.&nbsp; She was too much occupied to notice this at
first.&nbsp; Michael pointed it out to her, saying, with a
laugh,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at Willie! he might be a cast-off lover and
jealous of me, he looks so dark and downcast at me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Michael spoke this jest out loud, and Willie burst into tears,
and ran out of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go.&nbsp; Let me go!&rdquo; said Susan (for her
lover&rsquo;s arm was round her waist).&nbsp; &ldquo;I must go to
him if he&rsquo;s fretting.&nbsp; I promised mother I
would!&rdquo;&nbsp; She pulled herself away, and went in search
of the boy.&nbsp; She sought in byre and barn, through the
orchard, where indeed in this leafless winter-time there was no
great concealment; up into the room where the wool was usually
stored in the later summer, and at last she found him, sitting at
bay, like some hunted creature, up behind the wood-stack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are ye gone for, lad, and me seeking you
everywhere?&rdquo; asked she, breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know you would seek me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been
away many a time, and no one has cared to seek me,&rdquo; said
he, crying afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; replied Susan, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be
so foolish, ye little good-for-nought.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she crept
up to him in the hole he had made underneath the great, brown
sheafs of wood, and squeezed herself down by him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What for should folk seek after you, when you get away
from them whenever you can?&rdquo; asked she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t want me to stay.&nbsp; Nobody wants
me.&nbsp; If I go with father, he says I hinder more than I
help.&nbsp; You used to like to have me with you.&nbsp; But now,
you&rsquo;ve taken up with Michael, and you&rsquo;d rather I was
away; and I can just bide away; but I cannot stand Michael
jeering at me.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got you to love him and that
might serve him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I love you, too, dearly, lad!&rdquo; said she,
putting her arm round his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which on us do you like best?&rdquo; said he,
wistfully, after a little pause, putting her arm away, so that he
might look in her face, and see if she spoke truth.</p>
<p>She went very red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not ask such questions.&nbsp; They are not
fit for you to ask, nor for me to answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mother bade you love me!&rdquo; said he,
plaintively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I do.&nbsp; And so I ever will do.&nbsp; Lover
nor husband shall come betwixt thee and me, lad&mdash;ne&rsquo;er
a one of them.&nbsp; That I promise thee (as I promised mother
before), in the sight of God and with her hearkening now, if ever
she can hearken to earthly word again.&nbsp; Only I cannot abide
to have thee fretting, just because my heart is large enough for
two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And thou&rsquo;lt love me always?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always, and ever.&nbsp; And the more&mdash;the more
thou&rsquo;lt love Michael,&rdquo; said she, dropping her
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said the boy, sighing, for he
remembered many a harsh word and blow of which his sister knew
nothing.&nbsp; She would have risen up to go away, but he held
her tight, for here and now she was all his own, and he did not
know when such a time might come again.&nbsp; So the two sat
crouched up and silent, till they heard the horn blowing at the
field-gate, which was the summons home to any wanderers belonging
to the farm, and at this hour of the evening, signified that
supper was ready.&nbsp; Then the two went in.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Susan</span> and Michael were to be
married in April.&nbsp; He had already gone to take possession of
his new farm, three or four miles away from Yew Nook&mdash;but
that is neighbouring, according to the acceptation of the word in
that thinly-populated district,&mdash;when William Dixon fell
ill.&nbsp; He came home one evening, complaining of head-ache and
pains in his limbs, but seemed to loathe the posset which Susan
prepared for him; the treacle-posset which was the homely country
remedy against an incipient cold.&nbsp; He took to his bed with a
sensation of exceeding weariness, and an odd, unusual
looking-back to the days of his youth, when he was a lad living
with his parents, in this very house.</p>
<p>The next morning he had forgotten all his life since then, and
did not know his own children; crying, like a newly-weaned baby,
for his mother to come and soothe away his terrible pain.&nbsp;
The doctor from Coniston said it was the typhus-fever, and warned
Susan of its infectious character, and shook his head over his
patient.&nbsp; There were no near friends to come and share her
anxiety; only good, kind old Peggy, who was faithfulness itself,
and one or two labourers&rsquo; wives, who would fain have helped
her, had not their hands been tied by their responsibility to
their own families.&nbsp; But, somehow, Susan neither feared nor
flagged.&nbsp; As for fear, indeed, she had no time to give way
to it, for every energy of both body and mind was required.&nbsp;
Besides, the young have had too little experience of the danger
of infection to dread it much.&nbsp; She did indeed wish, from
time to time, that Michael had been at home to have taken Willie
over to his father&rsquo;s at High Beck; but then, again, the lad
was docile and useful to her, and his fecklessness in many things
might make him harshly treated by strangers; so, perhaps, it was
as well that Michael was away at Appleby fair, or even beyond
that&mdash;gone into Yorkshire after horses.</p>
<p>Her father grew worse; and the doctor insisted on sending over
a nurse from Coniston.&nbsp; Not a professed nurse&mdash;Coniston
could not have supported such a one; but a widow who was ready to
go where the doctor sent her for the sake of the payment.&nbsp;
When she came, Susan suddenly gave way; she was felled by the
fever herself, and lay unconscious for long weeks.&nbsp; Her
consciousness returned to her one spring afternoon; early spring:
April,&mdash;her wedding-month.&nbsp; There was a little fire
burning in the small corner-grate, and the flickering of the
blaze was enough for her to notice in her weak state.&nbsp; She
felt that there was some one sitting on the window-side of her
bed, behind the curtain, but she did not care to know who it was;
it was even too great a trouble for her languid mind to consider
who it was likely to be.&nbsp; She would rather shut her eyes,
and melt off again into the gentle luxury of sleep.&nbsp; The
next time she wakened, the Coniston nurse perceived her movement,
and made her a cup of tea, which she drank with eager relish; but
still they did not speak, and once more Susan lay
motionless&mdash;not asleep, but strangely, pleasantly conscious
of all the small chamber and household sounds; the fall of a
cinder on the hearth, the fitful singing of the half-empty
kettle, the cattle tramping out to field again after they had
been milked, the aged step on the creaking stair&mdash;old
Peggy&rsquo;s, as she knew.&nbsp; It came to her door; it
stopped; the person outside listened for a moment, and then
lifted the wooden latch, and looked in.&nbsp; The watcher by the
bedside arose, and went to her.&nbsp; Susan would have been glad
to see Peggy&rsquo;s face once more, but was far too weak to
turn, so she lay and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo; whispered one trembling, aged
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better,&rdquo; replied the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been awake, and had a cup of tea.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;ll do now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she asked after him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&nbsp; No; she has not spoken a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor lass! poor lass!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was shut.&nbsp; A weak feeling of sorrow and
self-pity came over Susan.&nbsp; What was wrong?&nbsp; Whom had
she loved?&nbsp; And dawning, dawning, slowly rose the sun of her
former life, and all particulars were made distinct to her.&nbsp;
She felt that some sorrow was coming to her, and cried over it
before she knew what it was, or had strength enough to ask.&nbsp;
In the dead of night,&mdash;and she had never slept
again,&mdash;she softly called to the watcher, and
asked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who what?&rdquo; replied the woman, with a conscious
affright, ill-veiled by a poor assumption of ease.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lie still, there&rsquo;s a darling, and go to sleep.&nbsp;
Sleep&rsquo;s better for you than all the doctor&rsquo;s
stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; repeated Susan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Something is
wrong.&nbsp; Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo; said the woman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong.&nbsp; Willie has taken the
turn, and is doing nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well! he&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; she answered,
looking another way, as if seeking for something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s Michael!&nbsp; Oh, me! oh,
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; She set up a succession of weak, plaintive,
hysterical cries before the nurse could pacify her, by declaring
that Michael had been at the house not three hours before to ask
after her, and looked as well and as hearty as ever man did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you heard of no harm to him since?&rdquo; inquired
Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless the lass, no, for sure!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
ne&rsquo;er heard his name named since I saw him go out of the
yard as stout a man as ever trod shoe-leather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was well, as the nurse said afterwards to Peggy, that Susan
had been so easily pacified by the equivocating answer in respect
to her father.&nbsp; If she had pressed the questions home in his
case as she did in Michael&rsquo;s, she would have learnt that he
was dead and buried more than a month before.&nbsp; It was well,
too, that in her weak state of convalescence (which lasted long
after this first day of consciousness) her perceptions were not
sharp enough to observe the sad change that had taken place in
Willie.&nbsp; His bodily strength returned, his appetite was
something enormous, but his eyes wandered continually; his regard
could not be arrested; his speech became slow, impeded, and
incoherent.&nbsp; People began to say that the fever had taken
away the little wit Willie Dixon had ever possessed and that they
feared that he would end in being a &ldquo;natural,&rdquo; as
they call an idiot in the Dales.</p>
<p>The habitual affection and obedience to Susan lasted longer
than any other feeling that the boy had had previous to his
illness; and, perhaps, this made her be the last to perceive what
every one else had long anticipated.&nbsp; She felt the awakening
rude when it did come.&nbsp; It was in this wise:&mdash;</p>
<p>One Jane evening, she sat out of doors under the yew-tree,
knitting.&nbsp; She was pale still from her recent illness; and
her languor, joined to the fact of her black dress, made her look
more than usually interesting.&nbsp; She was no longer the
buoyant self-sufficient Susan, equal to every occasion.&nbsp; The
men were bringing in the cows to be milked, and Michael was about
in the yard giving orders and directions with somewhat the air of
a master, for the farm belonged of right to Willie, and Susan had
succeeded to the guardianship of her brother.&nbsp; Michael and
she were to be married as soon as she was strong enough&mdash;so,
perhaps, his authoritative manner was justified; but the
labourers did not like it, although they said little.&nbsp; They
remembered a stripling on the farm, knowing far less than they
did, and often glad to shelter his ignorance of all agricultural
matters behind their superior knowledge.&nbsp; They would have
taken orders from Susan with far more willingness; nay, Willie
himself might have commanded them; and from the old hereditary
feeling toward the owners of land, they would have obeyed him
with far greater cordiality than they now showed to
Michael.&nbsp; But Susan was tired with even three rounds of
knitting, and seemed not to notice, or to care, how things went
on around her; and Willie&mdash;poor Willie!&mdash;there he stood
lounging against the door-sill, enormously grown and developed,
to be sure, but with restless eyes and ever-open mouth, and every
now and then setting up a strange kind of howling cry, and then
smiling vacantly to himself at the sound he had made.&nbsp; As
the two old labourers passed him, they looked at each other
ominously, and shook their heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie, darling,&rdquo; said Susan, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
make that noise&mdash;it makes my head ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke feebly, and Willie did not seem to hear; at any
rate, he continued his howl from time to time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold thy noise, wilt&rsquo;a?&rdquo; said Michael,
roughly, as he passed near him, and threatening him with his
fist.&nbsp; Susan&rsquo;s back was turned to the pair.&nbsp; The
expression of Willie&rsquo;s face changed from vacancy to fear,
and he came shambling up to Susan, who put her arm round him,
and, as if protected by that shelter, he began making faces at
Michael.&nbsp; Susan saw what was going on, and, as if now first
struck by the strangeness of her brother&rsquo;s manner, she
looked anxiously at Michael for an explanation.&nbsp; Michael was
irritated at Willie&rsquo;s defiance of him, and did not mince
the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just that the fever has left him
silly&mdash;he never was as wise as other folk, and now I doubt
if he will ever get right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan did not speak, but she went very pale, and her lip
quivered.&nbsp; She looked long and wistfully at Willie&rsquo;s
face, as he watched the motion of the ducks in the great
stable-pool.&nbsp; He laughed softly to himself every now and
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie likes to see the ducks go overhead,&rdquo; said
Susan, instinctively adopting the form of speech she would have
used to a young child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie, boo!&nbsp; Willie, boo!&rdquo; he replied,
clapping his hands, and avoiding her eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak properly, Willie,&rdquo; said Susan, making a
strong effort at self-control, and trying to arrest his
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who I am&mdash;tell me my name!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She grasped his arm almost painfully tight to make him
attend.&nbsp; Now he looked at her, and, for an instant, a gleam
of recognition quivered over his face; but the exertion was
evidently painful, and he began to cry at the vainness of the
effort to recall her name.&nbsp; He hid his face upon her
shoulder with the old affectionate trick of manner.&nbsp; She put
him gently away, and went into the house into her own little
bedroom.&nbsp; She locked the door, and did not reply at all to
Michael&rsquo;s calls for her, hardly spoke to old Peggy, who
tried to tempt her out to receive some homely sympathy, and
through the open easement there still came the idiotic sound of
&ldquo;Willie, boo!&nbsp; Willie, boo!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the stun of the blow came the
realization of the consequences.&nbsp; Susan would sit for hours
trying patiently to recall and piece together fragments of
recollection and consciousness in her brother&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp;
She would let him go and pursue some senseless bit of play, and
wait until she could catch his eye or his attention again, when
she would resume her self-imposed task.&nbsp; Michael complained
that she never had a word for him, or a minute of time to spend
with him now; but she only said she must try, while there was yet
a chance, to bring back her brother&rsquo;s lost wits.&nbsp; As
for marriage in this state of uncertainty, she had no heart to
think of it.&nbsp; Then Michael stormed, and absented himself for
two or three days; but it was of no use.&nbsp; When he came back,
he saw that she had been crying till her eyes were all swollen
up, and he gathered from Peggy&rsquo;s scoldings (which she did
not spare him) that Susan had eaten nothing since he went
away.&nbsp; But she was as inflexible as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not just yet.&nbsp; Only not just yet.&nbsp; And
don&rsquo;t say again that I do not love you,&rdquo; said she,
suddenly hiding herself in his arms.</p>
<p>And so matters went on through August.&nbsp; The crop of oats
was gathered in; the wheat-field was not ready as yet, when one
fine day Michael drove up in a borrowed shandry, and offered to
take Willie a ride.&nbsp; His manner, when Susan asked him where
he was going to, was rather confused; but the answer was straight
and clear enough.</p>
<p>He had business in Ambleside.&nbsp; He would never lose sight
of the lad, and have him back safe and sound before dark.&nbsp;
So Susan let him go.</p>
<p>Before night they were at home again: Willie in high delight
at a little rattling paper windmill that Michael had bought for
him in the street, and striving to imitate this new sound with
perpetual buzzings.&nbsp; Michael, too, looked pleased.&nbsp;
Susan knew the look, although afterwards she remembered that he
had tried to veil it from her, and had assumed a grave appearance
of sorrow whenever he caught her eye.&nbsp; He put up his horse;
for, although he had three miles further to go, the moon was
up&mdash;the bonny harvest-moon&mdash;and he did not care how
late he had to drive on such a road by such a light.&nbsp; After
the supper which Susan had prepared for the travellers was over,
Peggy went up-stairs to see Willie safe in bed; for he had to
have the same care taken of him that a little child of four years
old requires.</p>
<p>Michael drew near to Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Susan,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I took Will to see Dr.
Preston, at Kendal.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the first doctor in the
county.&nbsp; I thought it were better for us&mdash;for
you&mdash;to know at once what chance there were for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Susan, looking eagerly up.&nbsp; She
saw the same strange glance of satisfaction, the same instant
change to apparent regret and pain.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did he
say?&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak! can&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he would never get better of his
weakness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; never.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a long word, and hard to
bear.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s worse to come, dearest.&nbsp; The
doctor thinks he will get badder from year to year.&nbsp; And he
said, if he was us&mdash;you&mdash;he would send him off in time
to Lancaster Asylum.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve ways there both of
keeping such people in order and making them happy.&nbsp; I only
tell you what he said,&rdquo; continued he, seeing the gathering
storm in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no harm in his saying it,&rdquo; she replied,
with great self-constraint, forcing herself to speak coldly
instead of angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Folk is welcome to their
opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat silent for a minute or two, her breast heaving with
suppressed feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s counted a very clever man,&rdquo; said
Michael at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s none of my clever men, nor
am I going to be guided by him, whatever he may think.&nbsp; And
I don&rsquo;t thank them that went and took my poor lad to have
such harsh notions formed about him.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;d been
there, I could have called out the sense that is in
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not say more to-night,
Susan.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not taking it rightly, and I&rsquo;d
best be gone, and leave you to think it over.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
not deny they are hard words to hear, but there&rsquo;s sense in
them, as I take it; and I reckon you&rsquo;ll have to come to
&rsquo;em.&nbsp; Anyhow, it&rsquo;s a bad way of thanking me for
my pains, and I don&rsquo;t take it well in you, Susan,&rdquo;
said he, getting up, as if offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael, I&rsquo;m beside myself with sorrow.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t blame me if I speak sharp.&nbsp; He and me is the
only ones, you see.&nbsp; And mother did so charge me to have a
care of him!&nbsp; And this is what he&rsquo;s come to, poor lile
chap!&rdquo;&nbsp; She began to cry, and Michael to comfort her
with caresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
no use trying to make me forget poor Willie is a natural.&nbsp; I
could hate myself for being happy with you, even for just a
little minute.&nbsp; Go away, and leave me to face it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll think it over, Susan, and remember
what the doctor says?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; She meant
she could not forget what the doctor had said about the
hopelessness of her brother&rsquo;s case; Michael had referred to
the plan of sending Willie to an asylum, or madhouse, as they
were called in that day and place.&nbsp; The idea had been
gathering force in Michael&rsquo;s mind for some time; he had
talked it over with his father, and secretly rejoiced over the
possession of the farm and land which would then be his in fact,
if not in law, by right of his wife.&nbsp; He had always
considered the good penny her father could give her in his
catalogue of Susan&rsquo;s charms and attractions.&nbsp; But of
late he had grown to esteem her as the heiress of Yew Nook.&nbsp;
He, too, should have land like his brother&mdash;land to possess,
to cultivate, to make profit from, to bequeath.&nbsp; For some
time he had wondered that Susan had been so much absorbed in
Willie&rsquo;s present, that she had never seemed to look forward
to his future, state.&nbsp; Michael had long felt the boy to be a
trouble; but of late he had absolutely loathed him.&nbsp; His
gibbering, his uncouth gestures, his loose, shambling gait, all
irritated Michael inexpressibly.&nbsp; He did not come near the
Yew Nook for a couple of days.&nbsp; He thought that he would
leave her time to become anxious to see him and reconciled to his
plan.&nbsp; They were strange lonely days to Susan.&nbsp; They
were the first she had spent face to face with the sorrows that
had turned her from a girl into a woman; for hitherto Michael had
never let twenty-four hours pass by without coming to see her
since she had had the fever.&nbsp; Now that he was absent, it
seemed as though some cause of irritation was removed from Will,
who was much more gentle and tractable than he had been for many
weeks.&nbsp; Susan thought that she observed him making efforts
at her bidding, and there was something piteous in the way in
which he crept up to her, and looked wistfully in her face, as if
asking her to restore him the faculties that he felt to be
wanting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never will let thee go, lad.&nbsp; Never!&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s no knowing where they would take thee to, or what
they would do with thee.&nbsp; As it says in the Bible,
&lsquo;Nought but death shall part thee and me!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The country-side was full, in those days, of stories of the
brutal treatment offered to the insane; stories that were, in
fact, but too well founded, and the truth of one of which only
would have been a sufficient reason for the strong prejudice
existing against all such places.&nbsp; Each succeeding hour that
Susan passed, alone, or with the poor affectionate lad for her
sole companion, served to deepen her solemn resolution never to
part with him.&nbsp; So, when Michael came, he was annoyed and
surprised by the calm way in which she spoke, as if following Dr.
Preston&rsquo;s advice was utterly and entirely out of the
question.&nbsp; He had expected nothing less than a consent,
reluctant it might be, but still a consent; and he was extremely
irritated.&nbsp; He could have repressed his anger, but he chose
rather to give way to it; thinking that he could thus best work
upon Susan&rsquo;s affection, so as to gain his point.&nbsp; But,
somehow, he over-reached himself; and now he was astonished in
his turn at the passion of indignation that she burst into.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou wilt not bide in the same house with him,
say&rsquo;st thou?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no need for thy biding, as
far as I can tell.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s solemn reason why I should
bide with my own flesh and blood and keep to the word I pledged
my mother on her death-bed; but, as for thee, there&rsquo;s no
tie that I know on to keep thee fro&rsquo; going to America or
Botany Bay this very night, if that were thy inclination.&nbsp; I
will have no more of your threats to make me send my bairn
away.&nbsp; If thou marry me, thou&rsquo;lt help me to take
charge of Willie.&nbsp; If thou doesn&rsquo;t choose to marry me
on those terms&mdash;why, I can snap my fingers at thee, never
fear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not so far gone in love as that.&nbsp; But
I will not have thee, if thou say&rsquo;st in such a hectoring
way that Willie must go out of the house&mdash;and the house his
own too&mdash;before thoul&rsquo;t set foot in it.&nbsp; Willie
bides here, and I bide with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou hast may-be spoken a word too much,&rdquo; said
Michael, pale with rage.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I am free, as thou
say&rsquo;st, to go to Canada, or Botany Bay, I reckon I&rsquo;m
free to live where I like, and that will not be with a natural
who may turn into a madman some day, for aught I know.&nbsp;
Choose between him and me, Susy, for I swear to thee, thou
shan&rsquo;t have both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have chosen,&rdquo; said Susan, now perfectly
composed and still.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whatever comes of it, I bide
with Willie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied Michael, trying to assume an
equal composure of manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll wish you
a very good night.&rdquo;&nbsp; He went out of the house door,
half-expecting to be called back again; but, instead, he heard a
hasty step inside, and a bolt drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;I think I must
leave my lady alone for a week or two, and give her time to come
to her senses.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll not find it so easy as she
thinks to let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he went past the kitchen-window in nonchalant style, and
was not seen again at Yew Nook for some weeks.&nbsp; How did he
pass the time?&nbsp; For the first day or two, he was unusually
cross with all things and people that came athwart him.&nbsp;
Then wheat-harvest began, and he was busy, and exultant about his
heavy crop.&nbsp; Then a man came from a distance to bid for the
lease of his farm, which, by his father&rsquo;s advice, had been
offered for sale, as he himself was so soon likely to remove to
the Yew Nook.&nbsp; He had so little idea that Susan really would
remain firm to her determination, that he at once began to haggle
with the man who came after his farm, showed him the crop just
got in, and managed skilfully enough to make a good bargain for
himself.&nbsp; Of course, the bargain had to be sealed at the
public-house; and the companions he met with there soon became
friends enough to tempt him into Langdale, where again he met
with Eleanor Hebthwaite.</p>
<p>How did Susan pass the time?&nbsp; For the first day or so,
she was too angry and offended to cry.&nbsp; She went about her
household duties in a quick, sharp, jerking, yet absent way;
shrinking one moment from Will, overwhelming him with remorseful
caresses the next.&nbsp; The third day of Michael&rsquo;s
absence, she had the relief of a good fit of crying; and after
that, she grew softer and more tender; she felt how harshly she
had spoken to him, and remembered how angry she had been.&nbsp;
She made excuses for him.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was no wonder,&rdquo;
she said to herself, &ldquo;that he had been vexed with her; and
no wonder he would not give in, when she had never tried to speak
gently or to reason with him.&nbsp; She was to blame, and she
would tell him so, and tell him once again all that her mother
had bade her to be to Willie, and all the horrible stories she
had heard about madhouses, and he would be on her side at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so she watched for his coming, intending to apologise as
soon as ever she saw him.&nbsp; She hurried over her household
work, in order to sit quietly at her sewing, and hear the first
distant sound of his well-known step or whistle.&nbsp; But even
the sound of her flying needle seemed too loud&mdash;perhaps she
was losing an exquisite instant of anticipation; so she stopped
sewing, and looked longingly out through the geranium leaves, in
order that her eye might catch the first stir of the branches in
the wood-path by which he generally came.&nbsp; Now and then a
bird might spring out of the covert; otherwise the leaves were
heavily still in the sultry weather of early autumn.&nbsp; Then
she would take up her sewing, and, with a spasm of resolution,
she would determine that a certain task should be fulfilled
before she would again allow herself the poignant luxury of
expectation.&nbsp; Sick at heart was she when the evening closed
in, and the chances of that day diminished.&nbsp; Yet she stayed
up longer than usual, thinking that if he were coming&mdash;if he
were only passing along the distant road&mdash;the sight of a
light in the window might encourage him to make his appearance
even at that late hour, while seeing the house all darkened and
shut up might quench any such intention.</p>
<p>Very sick and weary at heart, she went to bed; too desolate
and despairing to cry, or make any moan.&nbsp; But in the morning
hope came afresh.&nbsp; Another day&mdash;another chance!&nbsp;
And so it went on for weeks.&nbsp; Peggy understood her young
mistress&rsquo;s sorrow full well, and respected it by her
silence on the subject.&nbsp; Willie seemed happier now that the
irritation of Michael&rsquo;s presence was removed; for the poor
idiot had a sort of antipathy to Michael, which was a kind of
heart&rsquo;s echo to the repugnance in which the latter held
him.&nbsp; Altogether, just at this time, Willie was the happiest
of the three.</p>
<p>As Susan went into Coniston, to sell her butter, one Saturday,
some inconsiderate person told her that she had seen Michael
Hurst the night before.&nbsp; I said inconsiderate, but I might
rather have said unobservant; for any one who had spent
half-an-hour in Susan Dixon&rsquo;s company might have seen that
she disliked having any reference made to the subjects nearest
her heart, were they joyous or grievous.&nbsp; Now she went a
little paler than usual (and she had never recovered her colour
since she had had the fever), and tried to keep silence.&nbsp;
But an irrepressible pang forced out the question&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Thomas Applethwaite&rsquo;s, in Langdale.&nbsp; They
had a kind of harvest-home, and he were there among the young
folk, and very thick wi&rsquo; Nelly Hebthwaite, old
Thomas&rsquo;s niece.&nbsp; Thou&rsquo;lt have to look after him
a bit, Susan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She neither smiled nor sighed.&nbsp; The neighbour who had
been speaking to her was struck with the gray stillness of her
face.&nbsp; Susan herself felt how well her self-command was
obeyed by every little muscle, and said to herself in her Spartan
manner, &ldquo;I can bear it without either wincing or
blenching.&rdquo;&nbsp; She went home early, at a tearing,
passionate pace, trampling and breaking through all obstacles of
briar or bush.&nbsp; Willie was moping in her
absence&mdash;hanging listlessly on the farm-yard gate to watch
for her.&nbsp; When he saw her, he set up one of his strange,
inarticulate cries, of which she was now learning the meaning,
and came towards her with his loose, galloping run, head and
limbs all shaking and wagging with pleasant excitement.&nbsp;
Suddenly she turned from him, and burst into tears.&nbsp; She sat
down on a stone by the wayside, not a hundred yards from home,
and buried her face in her hands, and gave way to a passion of
pent-up sorrow; so terrible and full of agony were her low cries,
that the idiot stood by her, aghast and silent.&nbsp; All his joy
gone for the time, but not, like her joy, turned into
ashes.&nbsp; Some thought struck him.&nbsp; Yes! the sight of her
woe made him think, great as the exertion was.&nbsp; He ran, and
stumbled, and shambled home, buzzing with his lips all the
time.&nbsp; She never missed him.&nbsp; He came back in a trice,
bringing with him his cherished paper windmill, bought on that
fatal day when Michael had taken him into Kendal to have his doom
of perpetual idiocy pronounced.&nbsp; He thrust it into
Susan&rsquo;s face, her hands, her lap, regardless of the injury
his frail plaything thereby received.&nbsp; He leapt before her
to think how he had cured all heart-sorrow, buzzing louder than
ever.&nbsp; Susan looked up at him, and that glance of her sad
eyes sobered him.&nbsp; He began to whimper, he knew not why: and
she now, comforter in her turn, tried to soothe him by twirling
his windmill.&nbsp; But it was broken; it made no noise; it would
not go round.&nbsp; This seemed to afflict Susan more than
him.&nbsp; She tried to make it right, although she saw the task
was hopeless; and while she did so, the tears rained down
unheeded from her bent head on the paper toy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said she, at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will never do again.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, somehow, she
took the accident and her words as omens of the love that was
broken, and that she feared could never be pieced together
more.&nbsp; She rose up and took Willie&rsquo;s hand, and the two
went slowly into the house.</p>
<p>To her surprise, Michael Hurst sat in the house-place.&nbsp;
House-place is a sort of better kitchen, where no cookery is
done, but which is reserved for state occasions.&nbsp; Michael
had gone in there because he was accompanied by his only sister,
a woman older than himself, who was well married beyond Keswick,
and who now came for the first time to make acquaintance with
Susan.&nbsp; Michael had primed his sister with his wishes
regarding Will, and the position in which he stood with Susan;
and arriving at Yew Nook in the absence of the latter, he had not
scrupled to conduct his sister into the guest-room, as he held
Mrs. Gale&rsquo;s worldly position in respect and admiration, and
therefore wished her to be favourably impressed with all the
signs of property which he was beginning to consider as
Susan&rsquo;s greatest charms.&nbsp; He had secretly said to
himself, that if Eleanor Hebthwaite and Susan Dixon were equal in
point of riches, he would sooner have Eleanor by far.&nbsp; He
had begun to consider Susan as a termagant; and when he thought
of his intercourse with her, recollections of her somewhat warm
and hasty temper came far more readily to his mind than any
remembrance of her generous, loving nature.</p>
<p>And now she stood face to face with him; her eyes
tear-swollen, her garments dusty, and here and there torn in
consequence of her rapid progress through the bushy
by-paths.&nbsp; She did not make a favourable impression on the
well-clad Mrs. Gale, dressed in her best silk gown, and therefore
unusually susceptible to the appearance of another.&nbsp; Nor
were Susan&rsquo;s manners gracious or cordial.&nbsp; How could
they be, when she remembered what had passed between Michael and
herself the last time they met?&nbsp; For her penitence had faded
away under the daily disappointment of these last weary
weeks.</p>
<p>But she was hospitable in substance.&nbsp; She bade Peggy
hurry on the kettle, and busied herself among the tea-cups,
thankful that the presence of Mrs. Gale, as a stranger, would
prevent the immediate recurrence to the one subject which she
felt must be present in Michael&rsquo;s mind as well as in her
own.&nbsp; But Mrs. Gale was withheld by no such feelings of
delicacy.&nbsp; She had come ready-primed with the case, and had
undertaken to bring the girl to reason.&nbsp; There was no time
to be lost.&nbsp; It had been prearranged between the brother and
sister that he was to stroll out into the farm-yard before his
sister introduced the subject; but she was so confident in the
success of her arguments, that she must needs have the triumph of
a victory as soon as possible; and, accordingly, she brought a
hail-storm of good reasons to bear upon Susan.&nbsp; Susan did
not reply for a long time; she was so indignant at this
intermeddling of a stranger in the deep family sorrow and
shame.&nbsp; Mrs. Gale thought she was gaining the day, and urged
her arguments more pitilessly.&nbsp; Even Michael winced for
Susan, and wondered at her silence.&nbsp; He shrank out of sight,
and into the shadow, hoping that his sister might prevail, but
annoyed at the hard way in which she kept putting the case.</p>
<p>Suddenly Susan turned round from the occupation she had
pretended to be engaged in, and said to him in a low voice, which
yet not only vibrated itself, but made its hearers thrill through
all their obtuseness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael Hurst! does your sister speak truth, think
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both women looked at him for his answer; Mrs. Gale without
anxiety, for had she not said the very words they had spoken
together before? had she not used the very arguments that he
himself had suggested?&nbsp; Susan, on the contrary, looked to
his answer as settling her doom for life; and in the gloom of her
eyes you might have read more despair than hope.</p>
<p>He shuffled his position.&nbsp; He shuffled in his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you ask?&nbsp; My sister has said many
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you,&rdquo; said Susan, trying to give a crystal
clearness both to her expressions and her pronunciation,
&ldquo;if, knowing as you do how Will is afflicted, you will help
me to take that charge of him which I promised my mother on her
death-bed that I would do; and which means, that I shall keep him
always with me, and do all in my power to make his life
happy.&nbsp; If you will do this, I will be your wife; if not, I
remain unwed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he may get dangerous; he can be but a trouble; his
being here is a pain to you, Susan, not a pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask you for either yes or no,&rdquo; said she, a
little contempt at his evading her question mingling with her
tone.&nbsp; He perceived it, and it nettled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have told you.&nbsp; I answered your question the
last time I was here.&nbsp; I said I would ne&rsquo;er keep house
with an idiot; no more I will.&nbsp; So now you&rsquo;ve gotten
your answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Susan.&nbsp; And she sighed
deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gale, encouraged by the
sigh; &ldquo;one would think you don&rsquo;t love Michael, Susan,
to be so stubborn in yielding to what I&rsquo;m sure would be
best for the lad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! she does not care for me,&rdquo; said
Michael.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she ever
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; asked
Susan, her eyes blazing out fire.&nbsp; She left the room
directly, and sent Peggy in to make the tea; and catching at
Will, who was lounging about in the kitchen, she went up-stairs
with him and bolted herself in, straining the boy to her heart,
and keeping almost breathless, lest any noise she made might
cause him to break out into the howls and sounds which she could
not bear that those below should hear.</p>
<p>A knock at the door.&nbsp; It was Peggy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants for to see you, to wish you
good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot come.&nbsp; Oh, Peggy, send them
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was her only cry for sympathy; and the old servant
understood it.&nbsp; She sent them away, somehow; not politely,
as I have been given to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good go with them,&rdquo; said Peggy, as she grimly
watched their retreating figures.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re rid of
bad rubbish, anyhow.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she turned into the house,
with the intention of making ready some refreshment for Susan,
after her hard day at the market, and her harder evening.&nbsp;
But in the kitchen, to which she passed through the empty
house-place, making a face of contemptuous dislike at the used
tea-cups and fragments of a meal yet standing there, she found
Susan, with her sleeves tucked up and her working apron on,
busied in preparing to make clap-bread, one of the hardest and
hottest domestic tasks of a Daleswoman.&nbsp; She looked up, and
first met, and then avoided Peggy&rsquo;s eye; it was too full of
sympathy.&nbsp; Her own cheeks were flushed, and her own eyes
were dry and burning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the board, Peggy?&nbsp; We need
clap-bread; and, I reckon, I&rsquo;ve time to get through with it
to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her voice had a sharp, dry tone in it, and
her motions a jerking angularity about them.</p>
<p>Peggy said nothing, but fetched her all that she needed.&nbsp;
Susan beat her cakes thin with vehement force.&nbsp; As she
stooped over them, regardless even of the task in which she
seemed so much occupied, she was surprised by a touch on her
mouth of something&mdash;what she did not see at first.&nbsp; It
was a cup of tea, delicately sweetened and cooled, and held to
her lips, when exactly ready, by the faithful old woman.&nbsp;
Susan held it off a hand&rsquo;s breath, and looked into
Peggy&rsquo;s eyes, while her own filled with the strange relief
of tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lass!&rdquo; said Peggy, solemnly, &ldquo;thou hast
done well.&nbsp; It is not long to bide, and then the end will
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are very old, Peggy,&rdquo; said Susan,
quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but a day sin&rsquo; I were young,&rdquo; replied
Peggy; but she stopped the conversation by again pushing the cup
with gentle force to Susan&rsquo;s dry and thirsty lips.&nbsp;
When she had drunken she fell again to her labour, Peggy heating
the hearth, and doing all that she knew would be required, but
never speaking another word.&nbsp; Willie basked close to the
fire, enjoying the animal luxury of warmth, for the autumn
evenings were beginning to be chilly.&nbsp; It was one
o&rsquo;clock before they thought of going to bed on that
memorable night.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> vehemence with which Susan
Dixon threw herself into occupation could not last for
ever.&nbsp; Times of languor and remembrance would
come&mdash;times when she recurred with a passionate yearning to
bygone days, the recollection of which was so vivid and
delicious, that it seemed as though it were the reality, and the
present bleak bareness the dream.&nbsp; She smiled anew at the
magical sweetness of some touch or tone which in memory she felt
and heard, and drank the delicious cup of poison, although at the
very time she knew what the consequences of racking pain would
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time, last year,&rdquo; thought she, &ldquo;we
went nutting together&mdash;this very day last year; just such a
day as to-day.&nbsp; Purple and gold were the lights on the
hills; the leaves were just turning brown; here and there on the
sunny slopes the stubble-fields looked tawny; down in a cleft of
yon purple slate-rock the beck fell like a silver glancing
thread; all just as it is to-day.&nbsp; And he climbed the
slender, swaying nut-trees, and bent the branches for me to
gather; or made a passage through the hazel copses, from time to
time claiming a toll.&nbsp; Who could have thought he loved me so
little?&mdash;who?&mdash;who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or, as the evening closed in, she would allow herself to
imagine that she heard his coming step, just that she might
recall time feeling of exquisite delight which had passed by
without the due and passionate relish at the time.&nbsp; Then she
would wonder how she could have had strength, the cruel,
self-piercing strength, to say what she had done; to stab himself
with that stern resolution, of which the sear would remain till
her dying day.&nbsp; It might have been right; but, as she
sickened, she wished she had not instinctively chosen the
right.&nbsp; How luxurious a life haunted by no stern sense of
duty must be!&nbsp; And many led this kind of life; why could not
she?&nbsp; O, for one hour again of his sweet company!&nbsp; If
he came now, she would agree to whatever he proposed.</p>
<p>It was a fever of the mind.&nbsp; She passed through it, and
came out healthy, if weak.&nbsp; She was capable once more of
taking pleasure in following an unseen guide through briar and
brake.&nbsp; She returned with tenfold affection to her
protecting care of Willie.&nbsp; She acknowledged to herself that
he was to be her all-in-all in life.&nbsp; She made him her
constant companion.&nbsp; For his sake, as the real owner of Yew
Nook, and she as his steward and guardian, she began that course
of careful saving, and that love of acquisition, which afterwards
gained for her the reputation of being miserly.&nbsp; She still
thought that he might regain a scanty portion of
sense&mdash;enough to require some simple pleasures and
excitement, which would cost money.&nbsp; And money should not be
wanting.&nbsp; Peggy rather assisted her in the formation of her
parsimonious habits than otherwise; economy was the order of the
district, and a certain degree of respectable avarice the
characteristic of her age.&nbsp; Only Willie was never stinted
nor hindered of anything that the two women thought could give
him pleasure, for want of money.</p>
<p>There was one gratification which Susan felt was needed for
the restoration of her mind to its more healthy state, after she
had passed through the whirling fever, when duty was as nothing,
and anarchy reigned; a gratification that, somehow, was to be her
last burst of unreasonableness; of which she knew and recognised
pain as the sure consequence.&nbsp; She must see him once
more,&mdash;herself unseen.</p>
<p>The week before the Christmas of this memorable year, she went
out in the dusk of the early winter evening, wrapped close in
shawl and cloak.&nbsp; She wore her dark shawl under her cloak,
putting it over her head in lieu of a bonnet; for she knew that
she might have to wait long in concealment.&nbsp; Then she
tramped over the wet fell-path, shut in by misty rain for miles
and miles, till she came to the place where he was lodging; a
farm-house in Langdale, with a steep, stony lane leading up to
it: this lane was entered by a gate out of the main road, and by
the gate were a few bushes&mdash;thorns; but of them the leaves
had fallen, and they offered no concealment: an old wreck of a
yew-tree grew among them, however, and underneath that Susan
cowered down, shrouding her face, of which the colour might
betray her, with a corner of her shawl.&nbsp; Long did she wait;
cold and cramped she became, too damp and stiff to change her
posture readily.&nbsp; And after all, he might never come!&nbsp;
But, she would wait till daylight, if need were; and she pulled
out a crust, with which she had providently supplied
herself.&nbsp; The rain had ceased,&mdash;a dull, still, brooding
weather had succeeded; it was a night to hear distant
sounds.&nbsp; She heard horses&rsquo; hoofs striking and
splashing in the stones, and in the pools of the road at her
back.&nbsp; Two horses; not well-ridden, or evenly guided, as she
could tell.</p>
<p>Michael Hurst and a companion drew near: not tipsy, but not
sober.&nbsp; They stopped at the gate to bid each other a maudlin
farewell.&nbsp; Michael stooped forward to catch the latch with
the hook of the stick which he carried; he dropped the stick, and
it fell with one end close to Susan,&mdash;indeed, with the
slightest change of posture she could have opened the gate for
him.&nbsp; He swore a great oath, and struck his horse with his
closed fist, as if that animal had been to blame; then he
dismounted, opened the gate, and fumbled about for his
stick.&nbsp; When he had found it (Susan had touched the other
end) his first use of it was to flog his horse well, and she had
much ado to avoid its kicks and plunges.&nbsp; Then, still
swearing, he staggered up the lane, for it was evident he was not
sober enough to remount.</p>
<p>By daylight Susan was back and at her daily labours at Yew
Nook.&nbsp; When the spring came, Michael Hurst was married to
Eleanor Hebthwaite.&nbsp; Others, too, were married, and
christenings made their firesides merry and glad; or they
travelled, and came back after long years with many wondrous
tales.&nbsp; More rarely, perhaps, a Dalesman changed his
dwelling.&nbsp; But to all households more change came than to
Yew Nook.&nbsp; There the seasons came round with monotonous
sameness; or, if they brought mutation, it was of a slow, and
decaying, and depressing kind.&nbsp; Old Peggy died.&nbsp; Her
silent sympathy, concealed under much roughness, was a loss to
Susan Dixon.&nbsp; Susan was not yet thirty when this happened,
but she looked a middle-aged, not to say an elderly woman.&nbsp;
People affirmed that she had never recovered her complexion since
that fever, a dozen years ago, which killed her father, and left
Will Dixon an idiot.&nbsp; But besides her gray sallowness, the
lines in her face were strong, and deep, and hard.&nbsp; The
movements of her eyeballs were slow and heavy; the wrinkles at
the corners of her mouth and eyes were planted firm and sure; not
an ounce of unnecessary flesh was there on her bones&mdash;every
muscle started strong and ready for use.&nbsp; She needed all
this bodily strength, to a degree that no human creature, now
Peggy was dead, knew of: for Willie had grown up large and strong
in body, and, in general, docile enough in mind; but, every now
and then, he became first moody, and then violent.&nbsp; These
paroxysms lasted but a day or two; and it was Susan&rsquo;s
anxious care to keep their very existence hidden and
unknown.&nbsp; It is true, that occasional passers-by on that
lonely road heard sounds at night of knocking about of furniture,
blows, and cries, as of some tearing demon within the solitary
farm-house; but these fits of violence usually occurred in the
night; and whatever had been their consequence, Susan had tidied
and redded up all signs of aught unusual before the
morning.&nbsp; For, above all, she dreaded lest some one might
find out in what danger and peril she occasionally was, and might
assume a right to take away her brother from her care.&nbsp; The
one idea of taking charge of him had deepened and deepened with
years.&nbsp; It was graven into her mind as the object for which
she lived.&nbsp; The sacrifice she had made for this object only
made it more precious to her.&nbsp; Besides, she separated the
idea of the docile, affectionate, loutish, indolent Will, and
kept it distinct from the terror which the demon that
occasionally possessed him inspired her with.&nbsp; The one was
her flesh and her blood&mdash;the child of her dead mother; the
other was some fiend who came to torture and convulse the
creature she so loved.&nbsp; She believed that she fought her
brother&rsquo;s battle in holding down those tearing hands, in
binding whenever she could those uplifted restless arms prompt
and prone to do mischief.&nbsp; All the time she subdued him with
her cunning or her strength, she spoke to him in pitying murmurs,
or abused the third person, the fiendish enemy, in no unmeasured
tones.&nbsp; Towards morning the paroxysm was exhausted, and he
would fall asleep, perhaps only to waken with evil and renewed
vigour.&nbsp; But when he was laid down, she would sally out to
taste the fresh air, and to work off her wild sorrow in cries and
mutterings to herself.&nbsp; The early labourers saw her gestures
at a distance, and thought her as crazed as the idiot-brother who
made the neighbourhood a haunted place.&nbsp; But did any chance
person call at Yew Nook later on in the day, he would find Susan
Dixon cold, calm, collected; her manner curt, her wits keen.</p>
<p>Once this fit of violence lasted longer than usual.&nbsp;
Susan&rsquo;s strength both of mind and body was nearly worn out;
she wrestled in prayer that somehow it might end before she, too,
was driven mad; or, worse, might be obliged to give up
life&rsquo;s aim, and consign Willie to a madhouse.&nbsp; From
that moment of prayer (as she afterwards superstitiously thought)
Willie calmed&mdash;and then he drooped&mdash;and then he
sank&mdash;and, last of all, he died in reality from physical
exhaustion.</p>
<p>But he was so gentle and tender as he lay on his dying bed;
such strange, child-like gleams of returning intelligence came
over his face, long after the power to make his dull,
inarticulate sounds had departed, that Susan was attracted to him
by a stronger tie than she had ever felt before.&nbsp; It was
something to have even an idiot loving her with dumb, wistful,
animal affection; something to have any creature looking at her
with such beseeching eyes, imploring protection from the
insidious enemy stealing on.&nbsp; And yet she knew that to him
death was no enemy, but a true friend, restoring light and health
to his poor clouded mind.&nbsp; It was to her that death was an
enemy; to her, the survivor, when Willie died; there was no one
to love her.</p>
<p>Worse doom still, there was no one left on earth for her to
love.</p>
<p>You now know why no wandering tourist could persuade her to
receive him as a lodger; why no tired traveller could melt her
heart to afford him rest and refreshment; why long habits of
seclusion had given her a moroseness of manner, and how care for
the interests of another had rendered her keen and miserly.</p>
<p>But there was a third act in the drama of her life.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> spite of Peggy&rsquo;s prophecy
that Susan&rsquo;s life should not seem long, it did seem
wearisome and endless, as the years slowly uncoiled their
monotonous circles.&nbsp; To be sure, she might have made change
for herself, but she did not care to do it.&nbsp; It was, indeed,
more than &ldquo;not caring,&rdquo; which merely implies a
certain degree of <i>vis inerti&aelig;</i> to be subdued before
an object can be attained, and that the object itself does not
seem to be of sufficient importance to call out the requisite
energy.&nbsp; On the contrary, Susan exerted herself to avoid
change and variety.&nbsp; She had a morbid dread of new faces,
which originated in her desire to keep poor dead Willie&rsquo;s
state a profound secret.&nbsp; She had a contempt for new
customs; and, indeed, her old ways prospered so well under her
active hand and vigilant eye, that it was difficult to know how
they could be improved upon.&nbsp; She was regularly present in
Coniston market with the best butter and the earliest chickens of
the season.&nbsp; Those were the common farm produce that every
farmer&rsquo;s wife about had to sell; but Susan, after she had
disposed of the more feminine articles, turned to on the
man&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; A better judge of a horse or cow there
was not in all the country round.&nbsp; Yorkshire itself might
have attempted to jockey her, and would have failed.&nbsp; Her
corn was sound and clean; her potatoes well preserved to the
latest spring.&nbsp; People began to talk of the hoards of money
Susan Dixon must have laid up somewhere; and one young
ne&rsquo;er-do-weel of a farmer&rsquo;s son undertook to make
love to the woman of forty, who looked fifty-five, if a
day.&nbsp; He made up to her by opening a gate on the road-path
home, as she was riding on a bare-backed horse, her purchase not
an hour ago.&nbsp; She was off before him, refusing his civility;
but the remounting was not so easy, and rather than fail she did
not choose to attempt it.&nbsp; She walked, and he walked
alongside, improving his opportunity, which, as he vainly
thought, had been consciously granted to him.&nbsp; As they drew
near Yew Nook, he ventured on some expression of a wish to keep
company with her.&nbsp; His words were vague and clumsily
arranged.&nbsp; Susan turned round and coolly asked him to
explain himself, he took courage, as he thought of her reputed
wealth, and expressed his wishes this second time pretty
plainly.&nbsp; To his surprise, the reply she made was in a
series of smart strokes across his shoulders, administered
through the medium of a supple hazel-switch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take that!&rdquo; said she, almost breathless,
&ldquo;to teach thee how thou darest make a fool of an honest
woman old enough to be thy mother.&nbsp; If thou com&rsquo;st a
step nearer the house, there&rsquo;s a good horse-pool, and
there&rsquo;s two stout fellows who&rsquo;ll like no better fun
than ducking thee.&nbsp; Be off wi&rsquo; thee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she strode into her own premises, never looking round to
see whether he obeyed her injunction or not.</p>
<p>Sometimes three or four years would pass over without her
hearing Michael Hurst&rsquo;s name mentioned.&nbsp; She used to
wonder at such times whether he were dead or alive.&nbsp; She
would sit for hours by the dying embers of her fire on a
winter&rsquo;s evening, trying to recall the scenes of her youth;
trying to bring up living pictures of the faces she had then
known&mdash;Michael&rsquo;s most especially.&nbsp; She thought it
was possible, so long had been the lapse of years, that she might
now pass by him in the street unknowing and unknown.&nbsp; His
outward form she might not recognize, but himself she should feel
in the thrill of her whole being.&nbsp; He could not pass her
unawares.</p>
<p>What little she did hear about him, all testified a downward
tendency.&nbsp; He drank&mdash;not at stated times when there was
no other work to be done, but continually, whether it was
seed-time or harvest.&nbsp; His children were all ill at the same
time; then one died, while the others recovered, but were poor
sickly things.&nbsp; No one dared to give Susan any direct
intelligence of her former lover; many avoided all mention of his
name in her presence; but a few spoke out either in indifference
to, or ignorance of, those bygone days.&nbsp; Susan heard every
word, every whisper, every sound that related to him.&nbsp; But
her eye never changed, nor did a muscle of her face move.</p>
<p>Late one November night she sat over her fire; not a human
being besides herself in the house; none but she had ever slept
there since Willie&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The farm-labourers had
foddered the cattle and gone home hours before.&nbsp; There were
crickets chirping all round the warm hearth-stones; there was the
clock ticking with the peculiar beat Susan had known from her
childhood, and which then and ever since she had oddly associated
within the idea of a mother and child talking together, one loud
tick, and quick&mdash;a feeble, sharp one following.</p>
<p>The day had been keen, and piercingly cold.&nbsp; The whole
lift of heaven seemed a dome of iron.&nbsp; Black and frost-bound
was the earth under the cruel east wind.&nbsp; Now the wind had
dropped, and as the darkness had gathered in, the weather-wise
old labourers prophesied snow.&nbsp; The sounds in the air arose
again, as Susan sat still and silent.&nbsp; They were of a
different character to what they had been during the prevalence
of the east wind.&nbsp; Then they had been shrill and piping; now
they were like low distant growling; not unmusical, but strangely
threatening.&nbsp; Susan went to the window, and drew aside the
little curtain.&nbsp; The whole world was white&mdash;the air was
blinded with the swift and heavy fall of snow.&nbsp; At present
it came down straight, but Susan knew those distant sounds in the
hollows and gulleys of the hills portended a driving wind and a
more cruel storm.&nbsp; She thought of her sheep; were they all
folded? the new-born calf, was it bedded well?&nbsp; Before the
drifts were formed too deep for her to pass in and out&mdash;and
by the morning she judged that they would be six or seven feet
deep&mdash;she would go out and see after the comfort of her
beasts.&nbsp; She took a lantern, and tied a shawl over her head,
and went out into the open air.&nbsp; She had tenderly provided
for all her animals, and was returning, when, borne on the blast
as if some spirit-cry&mdash;for it seemed to come rather down
from the skies than from any creature standing on earth&rsquo;s
level&mdash;she heard a voice of agony; she could not distinguish
words; it seemed rather as if some bird of prey was being caught
in the whirl of the icy wind, and torn and tortured by its
violence.&nbsp; Again up high above!&nbsp; Susan put down her
lantern, and shouted loud in return; it was an instinct, for if
the creature were not human, which she had doubted but a moment
before, what good could her responding cry do?&nbsp; And her cry
was seized on by the tyrannous wind, and borne farther away in
the opposite direction to that from which the call of agony had
proceeded.&nbsp; Again she listened; no sound: then again it rang
through space; and this time she was sure it was human.&nbsp; She
turned into the house, and heaped turf and wood on the fire,
which, careless of her own sensations, she had allowed to fade
and almost die out.&nbsp; She put a new candle in her lantern;
she changed her shawl for a maud, and leaving the door on latch,
she sallied out.&nbsp; Just at the moment when her ear first
encountered the weird noises of the storm, on issuing forth into
the open air, she thought she heard the words, &ldquo;O
God!&nbsp; O help!&rdquo;&nbsp; They were a guide to her, if
words they were, for they came straight from a rock not a quarter
of a mile from Yew Nook, but only to be reached, on account of
its precipitous character, by a round-about path.&nbsp; Thither
she steered, defying wind and snow; guided by here a thorn-tree,
there an old, doddered oak, which had not quite lest their
identity under the whelming mask of snow.&nbsp; Now and then she
stopped to listen; but never a word or sound heard she, till
right from where the copse-wood grew thick and tangled at the
base of the rock, round which she was winding, she heard a
moan.&nbsp; Into the brake&mdash;all snow in
appearance&mdash;almost a plain of snow looked on from the little
eminence where she stood&mdash;she plunged, breaking down the
bush, stumbling, bruising herself, fighting her way; her lantern
held between her teeth, and she herself using head as well as
hands to butt away a passage, at whatever cost of bodily
injury.&nbsp; As she climbed or staggered, owing to the
unevenness of the snow-covered ground, where the briars and weeds
of years were tangled and matted together, her foot felt
something strangely soft and yielding.&nbsp; She lowered her
lantern; there lay a man, prone on his face, nearly covered by
the fast-falling flakes; he must have fallen from the rock above,
as, not knowing of the circuitous path, he had tried to descend
its steep, slippery face.&nbsp; Who could tell? it was no time
for thinking.&nbsp; Susan lifted him up with her wiry strength;
he gave no help&mdash;no sign of life; but for all that he might
be alive: he was still warm; she tied her maud round him; she
fastened the lantern to her apron-string; she held him tight:
half-carrying, half-dragging&mdash;what did a few bruises signify
to him, compared to dear life, to precious life!&nbsp; She got
him through the brake, and down the path.&nbsp; There, for an
instant, she stopped to take breath; but, as if stung by the
Furies, she pushed on again with almost superhuman
strength.&nbsp; Clasping him round the waist, and leaning his
dead weight against the lintel of the door, she tried to undo the
latch; but now, just at this moment, a trembling faintness came
over her, and a fearful dread took possession of her&mdash;that
here, on the very threshold of her home, she might be found dead,
and buried under the snow, when the farm-servants came in the
morning.&nbsp; This terror stirred her up to one more
effort.&nbsp; Then she and her companion were in the warmth of
the quiet haven of that kitchen; she laid him on the settle, and
sank on the floor by his side.&nbsp; How long she remained in
this swoon she could not tell; not very long she judged by the
fire, which was still red and sullenly glowing when she came to
herself.&nbsp; She lighted the candle, and bent over her late
burden to ascertain if indeed he were dead.&nbsp; She stood long
gazing.&nbsp; The man lay dead.&nbsp; There could be no doubt
about it.&nbsp; His filmy eyes glared at her, unshut.&nbsp; But
Susan was not one to be affrighted by the stony aspect of
death.&nbsp; It was not that; it was the bitter, woeful
recognition of Michael Hurst!</p>
<p>She was convinced he was dead; but after a while she refused
to believe in her conviction.&nbsp; She stripped off his wet
outer-garments with trembling, hurried hands.&nbsp; She brought a
blanket down from her own bed; she made up the fire.&nbsp; She
swathed him in fresh, warm wrappings, and laid him on the flags
before the fire, sitting herself at his head, and holding it in
her lap, while she tenderly wiped his loose, wet hair, curly
still, although its colour had changed from nut-brown to
iron-gray since she had seen it last.&nbsp; From time to time she
bent over the face afresh, sick, and fain to believe that the
flicker of the fire-light was some slight convulsive
motion.&nbsp; But the dim, staring eyes struck chill to her
heart.&nbsp; At last she ceased her delicate, busy cares: but she
still held the head softly, as if caressing it.&nbsp; She thought
over all the possibilities and chances in the mingled yarn of
their lives that might, by so slight a turn, have ended far
otherwise.&nbsp; If her mother&rsquo;s cold had been early
tended, so that the responsibility as to her brother&rsquo;s weal
or woe had not fallen upon her; if the fever had not taken such
rough, cruel hold on Will; nay, if Mrs. Gale, that hard, worldly
sister, had not accompanied him on his last visit to Yew
Nook&mdash;his very last before this fatal, stormy might; if she
had heard his cry,&mdash;cry uttered by these pale, dead lips
with such wild, despairing agony, not yet three hours
ago!&mdash;O! if she had but heard it sooner, he might have been
saved before that blind, false step had precipitated him down the
rock!&nbsp; In going over this weary chain of unrealized
possibilities, Susan learnt the force of Peggy&rsquo;s
words.&nbsp; Life was short, looking back upon it.&nbsp; It
seemed but yesterday since all the love of her being had been
poured out, and run to waste.&nbsp; The intervening
years&mdash;the long monotonous years that had turned her into an
old woman before her time&mdash;were but a dream.</p>
<p>The labourers coming in the dawn of the winter&rsquo;s day
were surprised to see the fire-light through the low
kitchen-window.&nbsp; They knocked, and hearing a moaning answer,
they entered, fearing that something had befallen their
mistress.&nbsp; For all explanation they got these words</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Michael Hurst.&nbsp; He was belated, and fell
down the Raven&rsquo;s Crag.&nbsp; Where does Eleanor, his wife,
live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How Michael Hurst got to Yew Nook no one but Susan ever
knew.&nbsp; They thought he had dragged himself there, with some
sore internal bruise sapping away his minuted life.&nbsp; They
could not have believed the superhuman exertion which had first
sought him out, and then dragged him hither.&nbsp; Only Susan
knew of that.</p>
<p>She gave him into the charge of her servants, and went out and
saddled her horse.&nbsp; Where the wind had drifted the snow on
one side, and the road was clear and bare, she rode, and rode
fast; where the soft, deceitful heaps were massed up, she
dismounted and led her steed, plunging in deep, with fierce
energy, the pain at her heart urging her onwards with a sharp,
digging spur.</p>
<p>The gray, solemn, winter&rsquo;s noon was more night-like than
the depth of summer&rsquo;s night; dim-purple brooded the low
skies over the white earth, as Susan rode up to what had been
Michael Hurst&rsquo;s abode while living.&nbsp; It was a small
farm-house carelessly kept outside, slatternly tended
within.&nbsp; The pretty Nelly Hebthwaite was pretty still; her
delicate face had never suffered from any long-enduring
feeling.&nbsp; If anything, its expression was that of plaintive
sorrow; but the soft, light hair had scarcely a tinge of gray;
the wood-rose tint of complexion yet remained, if not so
brilliant as in youth; the straight nose, the small mouth were
untouched by time.&nbsp; Susan felt the contrast even at that
moment.&nbsp; She knew that her own skin was weather-beaten,
furrowed, brown,&mdash;that her teeth were gone, and her hair
gray and ragged.&nbsp; And yet she was not two years older than
Nelly,&mdash;she had not been, in youth, when she took account of
these things.&nbsp; Nelly stood wondering at the strange-enough
horse-woman, who stopped and panted at the door, holding her
horse&rsquo;s bridle, and refusing to enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Michael Hurst?&rdquo; asked Susan, at
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t rightly say.&nbsp; He should have
been at home last night, but he was off, seeing after a
public-house to be let at Ulverstone, for our farm does not
answer, and we were thinking&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not come home last night?&rdquo; said Susan,
cutting short the story, and half-affirming, half-questioning, by
way of letting in a ray of the awful light before she let it full
in, in its consuming wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! he&rsquo;ll be stopping somewhere out Ulverstone
ways.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;ve need of him at home, for
I&rsquo;ve no one but lile Tommy to help me tend the
beasts.&nbsp; Things have not gone well with us, and we
don&rsquo;t keep a servant now.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re trembling
all over, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better come in, and take
something warm, while your horse rests.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
stable-door, to your left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan took her horse there; loosened his girths, and rubbed
him down with a wisp of straw.&nbsp; Then she hooked about her
for hay; but the place was bare of feed, and smelt damp and
unused.&nbsp; She went to the house, thankful for the respite,
and got some clap-bread, which she mashed up in a pailful of
lukewarm water.&nbsp; Every moment was a respite, and yet every
moment made her dread the more the task that lay before
her.&nbsp; It would be longer than she thought at first.&nbsp;
She took the saddle off, and hung about her horse, which seemed,
somehow, more like a friend than anything else in the
world.&nbsp; She laid her cheek against its neck, and rested
there, before returning to the house for the last time.</p>
<p>Eleanor had brought down one of her own gowns, which hung on a
chair against the fire, and had made her unknown visitor a cup of
hot tea.&nbsp; Susan could hardly bear all these little
attentions: they choked her, and yet she was so wet, so weak with
fatigue and excitement, that she could neither resist by voice or
by action.&nbsp; Two children stood awkwardly about, puzzled at
the scene, and even Eleanor began to wish for some explanation of
who her strange visitor was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve, maybe, heard him speaking of me?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m called Susan Dixon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nelly coloured, and avoided meeting Susan&rsquo;s eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard other folk speak of you.&nbsp; He
never named your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This respect of silence came like balm to Susan: balm not felt
or heeded at the time it was applied, but very grateful in its
effects for all that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is at my house,&rdquo; continued Susan, determined
not to stop or quaver in the operation&mdash;the pain which must
be inflicted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your house?&nbsp; Yew Nook?&rdquo; questioned
Eleanor, surprised.&nbsp; &ldquo;How came he
there?&rdquo;&mdash;half jealously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did he take
shelter from the coming storm?&nbsp; Tell me,&mdash;there is
something&mdash;tell me, woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He took no shelter.&nbsp; Would to God he
had!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O! would to God! would to God!&rdquo; shrieked out
Eleanor, learning all from the woful import of those dreary
eyes.&nbsp; Her cries thrilled through the house; the
children&rsquo;s piping wailings and passionate cries on
&ldquo;Daddy!&nbsp; Daddy!&rdquo; pierced into Susan&rsquo;s very
marrow.&nbsp; But she remained as still and tearless as the great
round face upon the clock.</p>
<p>At last, in a lull of crying, she said,&mdash;not exactly
questioning, but as if partly to herself&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You loved him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loved him! he was my husband!&nbsp; He was the father
of three bonny bairns that lie dead in Grasmere churchyard.&nbsp;
I wish you&rsquo;d go, Susan Dixon, and let me weep without your
watching me!&nbsp; I wish you&rsquo;d never come near the
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! alas! it would not have brought him to
life.&nbsp; I would have laid down my own to save his.&nbsp; My
life has been so very sad!&nbsp; No one would have cared if I had
died.&nbsp; Alas! alas!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone in which she said this was so utterly mournful and
despairing that it awed Nelly into quiet for a time.&nbsp; But
by-and-by she said, &ldquo;I would not turn a dog out to do it
harm; but the night is clear, and Tommy shall guide you to the
Red Cow.&nbsp; But, oh, I want to be alone!&nbsp; If you&rsquo;ll
come back to-morrow, I&rsquo;ll be better, and I&rsquo;ll hear
all, and thank you for every kindness you have shown
him,&mdash;and I do believe you&rsquo;ve showed him
kindness,&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t know why.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan moved heavily and strangely.</p>
<p>She said something&mdash;her words came thick and
unintelligible.&nbsp; She had had a paralytic stroke since she
had last spoken.&nbsp; She could not go, even if she would.&nbsp;
Nor did Eleanor, when she became aware of the state of the case,
wish her to leave.&nbsp; She had her laid on her own bed, and
weeping silently all the while for her lest husband, she nursed
Susan like a sister.&nbsp; She did not know what her
guest&rsquo;s worldly position might be; and she might never be
repaid.&nbsp; But she sold many a little trifle to purchase such
small comforts as Susan needed.&nbsp; Susan, lying still and
motionless, learnt much.&nbsp; It was not a severe stroke; it
might be the forerunner of others yet to come, but at some
distance of time.&nbsp; But for the present she recovered, and
regained much of her former health.&nbsp; On her sick-bed she
matured her plans.&nbsp; When she returned to Yew Nook, she took
Michael Hurst&rsquo;s widow and children with her to live there,
and fill up the haunted hearth with living forms that should
banish the ghosts.</p>
<p>And so it fell out that the latter days of Susan Dixon&rsquo;s
life were better than the former.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
